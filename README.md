# Todo-rs
 [WIP] A fast, easy-to-use, self-organizing to-do list built in Rust. Can currently do all basic features

 ## My desire for this todo list:
I have used a few applications to create a to-do list. At the top of the complexity spectrum is Notion, which for me ended up being too much. Then I went to the bottom of the complexity spectrum, which is just building a to-do list out of a notes app. That was simple to start but just ended up not having enough capabilities for it to be useful. Over the years, the best to-do list I used was Todoist. Todoist is built to implement any type of task organization philosophy. Taking inspiration from that design, I want to build an easy-to-use to-do list that implements an organization philosophy that I commonly use. Hopefully, this to-do list can become the main tool that I use!
 ## Basic features
 - Add tasks
 - Delete tasks
 - Complete tasks
 - Display task list
 
 ## Advanced features
 - Sort tasks based on 4 quadrants of task categorization
 - keep memory of task list locally

## Final features
  - clean ui
  - commands simple
  - optimize/refactor code
  - use list anywhere and save in cloud or in some way communicate task file across devices
